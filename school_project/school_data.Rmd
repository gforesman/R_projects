```{r}

packages <- c("tidyverse", "readxl", "car","corrplot", "gtsummary", "gt")

Reading in the data
```{r}
dataFull <- read.csv("StudentPerformanceFactors.csv")
dataFull

```

```{r re-scoring data}




```





Creating some simple regressions to model some factors for student success
```{r correlations}
#EDA with correlations first 
corr <- cor(dataFull)
corr_r <- rcorr(dataFull)
corr_p <- cor.mtest(dataFull, conf.level=0.95)

corr %>%
  corrplot()


```
